/*
This code snippet is using Recoil, which is a state management library for React. In this snippet, atomFamily is a function provided by Recoil to create a family of atoms. A family of atoms allows you to have multiple related atoms that share the same state, but with different initialization values based on some parameter.

Here, todosAtomFamily is a family of atoms where each atom represents a todo item. It's initialized with a default value function that takes an id parameter and returns the corresponding todo item from the TODOS array where id matches.

So, when you use todosAtomFamily, you'll get an atom specific to a todo item identified by its id. For example, if you call todosAtomFamily(1), it will return an atom representing the todo item with an id of 1.
